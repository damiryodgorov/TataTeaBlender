# `git-fire` üî•

### ![Inspiration](https://i.imgur.com/3POtveC.jpg)

`git-fire` is a Git plugin that **helps in the event of an emergency** by adding all current files, committing, and pushing to a new branch (to prevent merge conflicts).

**Alias it to [`git out`](https://np.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3nc531/in_case_of_fire/cvmxnv1) or [`git going`](https://np.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3nc531/in_case_of_fire/cvmsajb) for comedic effect.**

- `git config --global alias.out fire`
- `git config --global alias.going fire`

## What It Does

- creates new branch `fire-<current branch>-<user email>-<current epoch>`
- adds all files
- commits with `"Fire! Branch <new branch>"` or custom message
- pushes to remote

## Usage

`git-fire <message>`

`<message>` is optional. If not specified, `"Fire! Branch fire-<current branch>-<user email>-<current epoch>"` will be used.

## Installation

Just copy `git-fire` to your `$PATH` and ensure it is an executable (`chmod +x git-fire`) and you're good to go. üëç

Also make sure you have Git installed.
